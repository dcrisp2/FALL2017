WHY
High efficiency named as a reason for using EBIT, specifically narrow charge state distrobutions and less ions lost "in many charge states"
	are there charge states where more ions are lost? Why have this stipulation?

Fast and Variable breeding times (~10ms to 1s)
Low contamination
Variable ejected ion distributions, extraction pulse widths (~20us up to ~100ms)

WORKING PRINCIPLES
Produce & trap highly charged ions w/ high-current density beam
Primary Components: e-gun, trap + "strong" magnet, e-collector
Magnetic field: electron-beam compression & Ionization by electron impact
axial ion confinement provided by potential well (trap electrodes)
radial ion confinement by the electron-beam space-charge potential

## How is radius of e-beam compressed, what is current density, and effective space-charge potential
## What is the potential of the source held at, and how are trap values set
## Is magnet's only purpose to confine the electrons, what is it's effect on resulting emittance? Is magnetic pressure on ions significant to their temperature here? Maybe the collision rate is more significant

Key Parameters
Magnetic field: 4T
Electron-Beam current < 1.4 A
Current density: ~170 A/cm^2 for 300mA (stable 24/7)
E-Beam energy < 30 keV (e.g., Ne-like U82+)
Length of trapping region: 0.64 magnet
Trap structure & 4K


## With typical pulse width ("Natural" width) of ~20us, defined by time to freely exit trap, what can the instantaneous rate be? what can be achieved by elongating extraction potential?

Charge Breeding Efficiencies
Typical QA scan (all contaminants) compared to that of the charge state distrobutions of 39K or 85Rb
ACS and SCS for 39K and 85Rb
## Can I reproduce that charge breeding time using Lotz's formula for the cross section?


## WHY WOULD emittance INCREASE with e-beam current?
	Maybe if done by increasing anode, as perveance doesn't change, ridgidity of electrons would, so they'd be less compressed by magnet..
