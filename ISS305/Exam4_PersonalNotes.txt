Representativeness Heuristic
	probability judgments are often based on how representative certain features of events are to what we already know
PROBABILITY OF 4th child... equal as a chance of a child... however I think the chances of 4 children all being boys is pretty small compared to 3 boys and 1 girl...
Gambler's Fallacy
	The tendency to see links between events in the past and events in the future when the two are really independent
Conjunction Fallacy
	Judging that probability of (A and B) > min (Prob(A), Prob(B))
Belief in a Just World

Null Hypothesis (No Effect)
	The data for the groups are so similar that the scores must ahve been drawn from the same population
	often the reverse of what an experimenter actually believes
	Researchers probably wants (and tries) to reject the null hypothesis - devil's advocate position
Alternate Hypothesis (There's an effect)
	The data for each group came from different populations
	Specifies values for the parameter that are incompatible with the null hypothesis
	A decision to reject null implies an acceptance of alternative
	
Causal Heuristics
Spectacular Explanation Fallacy
	Extraordinary events do not require extraordinary causes
Intervention-Causation Fallacy
	The cure doesn't prove the cause
Insight Fallacy
	To understand something isn't necessarily to change it

Quasi-Experiments
Grouping variable
	Independant variable is a pre-existing 'grouping variable' and as such is not manipulated (i.e. gender, ethnicity)

Experimental Designs
Between-subjects
	Each participant participates in one and only one condition
Within-subjects
	Each participant participates in all conditions
	
Threats to Internal Validity
Ambiguous Temporal Precedence
	Does causal variable come before the effect variable in time
Selection (cohort effect)
	Differences between groups form the start
History
	Events outside of the experiment may affect responses
Maturation
	Naturally occuring changes over time
Regression
	Phenomenon that if a variable is extreme on it's first measurement, it will tend to be closer to the average on its second measurement
Attrition/Mortality
	Some participants fail to complete the EDVs
Testing
	Repeated testing might influence scores
Instrumentation
	Change in a measuring instrument
Additive and Interactive effects of threats to internal validity
	More than one threat occuring
